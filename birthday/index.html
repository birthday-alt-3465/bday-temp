      <p>Dear Aria,</p>

        <p>Happy 18<sup>th</sup> Birthday!!1!!1! zamn the little goofball is turning 18!!, now you can legally drink and drive frfr (dont do that coz youll die and that'll suck) dont do both together, anyways yes I still remember dming this lil calico car right here cause I noticed if I still remember right; 'Real life cupid' in your bio so curiosity made me dm and ask what that was about (coz honestly I had no clue tf a cupid was back then ðŸ’€) and boom I met this goofy goober. And ngl,  I'm not really the one to initiate a dm with someone almost all of the times, its probably them who dms me to ask abt smth or say something to me and in few cases, talks more with them and becomes friends. But I'm so glad I initiated a conversation here, 'cause I met you! :D</p>
        <br>
        <p>Honestly I had no clue we'd get along well and this close back then, especially since you're so innocent and nice, and me on the other hand, racist and stuff xD</p>
        <br>
        <p>I genuinely want to thank you for putting up with my bs such as ofc the racist jokes, dark memes, sus stuff iykyk, smurfing, bullying, etc etc on a daily basis for the past 7 months.  I hope you will never get bored of my shits :></p>
        <br>
        <p>And I want you to know that I genuinely care about you, even if my jokes or whatever I said and what not has ever has made you feel like otherwise, just know that deep down I care about you. a lot. And I'll never get bored of listening to you about your days or how you're feeling when you have a bad day on valo or just generally, I love to listen to them and help you with it. So ye please dont stop that frfr (threat (jk))</p>
        <br>
        <p>So yeah, I don't know what else to say cause that's pretty much all I wanted to say. and yeah, once again, I wish you a Happy 18th Happy birthday kennieeeeeeee!!!!!!1!! I hope you have a good oneðŸ’œ</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <h1>Happy 16<sup>th</sup> Birthday Aria!!!</h1>
      <h2>27/05/2025</h2>
      <p>Dear Aria,</p>

        <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY 16<sup>th</sup> BIRTHDAY!ü§ç‚ú®  I'll probably be sleeping when you read this so I thought I'd write something for my lil lizard to read while I wasn't with you.  Initially I thought of sending you this as a message but then I figured that was pretty cliche and boring, plus they have that shitty character limit so I accidentally made a whole ass site for you oops. Anyways. I still remember adding you that night cause I was bored, saw the general chat in the cas server and added whoever that was active at that time. I remember scaring you off with my liking for liminal spaces with little lighting (they're cozy stfu).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Honestly I never thought we'd get along this well, usually I'm not the type to join a server and add random people who I have never talked with, and even if I talk with someone, It's very unlikely its me who initiates the friend request, but ykw, I'm glad I did.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I used to think you were from the US cause of the time you'd go to sleep and wake up, cause my friends who are actually from there goes to sleep at like morning/afternoon for me and wake up at when its like evening/night for me, you used to do that so I assumed you were from US lol</p>
        <br>
        <p>Also quit with the "rawr" "purrr" and allat furry shit istg I'll grab my flamethrower and burn ur lizard ass to ashes. I hate furries. Btw you should get a pc or fix ur laptop so I can host a minecraft world for us yk, im gonna bully you sm in it >:) And we'll play tons of co-op games from steam.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm really looking forward to July tho cause you'll be free and we'll binge watch shows, but for now I wanna finish watching Stranger Things with you. I love that show so much, I've legit watched it from end to end atleast 20 times by now, not even exaggerating.. I really hope you like it as much as I do too, and if you dont, well lets just say I know where you live üî™ (jk) I want you to pay attention to the soundtracks in it when we watch, all of that is made with actual physical synths, the real deal. ok idk why im goin on a tangent about a series on a birthday letter....anyways....</p>
        <br>
        <p>And I want you to know that I genuinely care about you. Even if my jokes or anything I've said ever has made you feel like otherwise, just know that deep down, I care about you. a lot. And I'll never get bored of listening to you about your days or how you're feeling when you have a bad day or just about anything at all. I love you listen to you and help you with it. So yeah, please don't ever back off from telling me anything just cause you thought I'd probably be busy or you're wasting my time or bothering me etc, I'd make time to listen. I love you Aria.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So yeah, I don't know what else to say cause that's pretty much all I wanted to say. And yeah, once again, I wish you a Happy 16<sup>th</sup> Birthday Aria!!!</p> 
        <br> 
        <p>I hope you have a good oneüñ§</p>
        <br>
        <p>With a love I just can't escape,</p>
